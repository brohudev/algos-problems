# tuesday sep 19 work

- realized that i implemented merge and mergesort wrong.

  todos for tmrw

- [X] implement marge and mergesort from the code blocks from 2436 folder, in content/week3/ basic sorting pdf. page 7

- then implement the helper function and modify the two merge and mergesorts. hopefully by doing this you avoid all the random seg faults.

# Wednesday sep 20 work

- [X] implement the helper function
- [X] modify mergesort to take in two arrays
- [X] modify the merge function to take in two arrays and
- [X] deploy helper while merging.

done!

i managed to finish the algorithm as described. there was a pass by reference issue ( i wasn't passing rachelarray by reference and that led to the nums getting lost somewhere. but it works now...
