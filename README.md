# Algos Problems

This repository contains my worked out code for all the coding problems we got in Algorithms (COSC 3320) (or atleast, the ones I managed to complete anyway)

I do have my notes from the completed problems written in devlog (I realized I should add it until I was late into the semester but feel free to browse it ig)

the problems I did also more than likely will contain pseudocode I used to generate the C++ programs within the same C++ file as Comments over the function, or at the very end.
