## warning:
I only started to keep a log of my assignments late into the semester, when only 3 more p sets were remaining. 

This means the devlog is **incomplete**. this will also be reflected in the commits as well. 

However (*\*insert meme gif*), 

enjoy the log for the problems that DO exist :D

# Problem Set 10
Assigned:Tuesday 10/31/23
Due: Sunday 11/19/23

## Problem 3
#### 11/14 Tuesday:
- got the code to compile and run, but it is acting strangely
	- test case 0 and 1 have an off by one error
	- test case 2 thru 5 time out 
	- test cases 6 and 7 work just fine
- at this rate i have two options:
	1. submit an alternative submission because only some of them ran
	2. try to fix it, as I have all the test cases.

## Problem 26
#### 11/16 Thursday
- I ahve neglected this problem up till now 

#### 11/19 Sunday
##### 1pm update:
- The procrastination cycles are too strong, but i must return to the problem once again if i want to keep my grades afloat
- the plan for today is to make sure i have the codeto input and output the graph, then work on whatever first searc that i have in pseudocode somewhere on my phone, and then jank it all together.
##### 4pm update:
- so i spent two hours trying to implement the pseudocode itself and realized that debugging this will push the correct implementation waay beyond the deadline. ive just accepted my fate atp. 
the new plan is to submit an alternate submission for p3 to salvage enough opints and get started ahead on this weeks problems. matter of fact i will make the first commit for that shortly after finishing up on the alternate submission commit.

Due: 11/28/23 Tuesday

## Problem 25
### Thursday 11/23
#### 5 pm update:
- I have 5 days to finish both problems. the goal for today is to finish up the implemenation of graphs and the algorithms for both problems. this way i can start hunting bugs starting tomorrow.
#### 6pm update:
- the pseudocode makes no sense. I'm going to whip up my own pseudo for this problem.

## Problem 27
### Thursday 11/23
#### 6pm update:
- Time to work on this pseudo while I take a break from p25
- [ ] write up this graph class from p27 as its own standalone code for copy pasta use later. 
### Saturday 11/25
#### 6pm update
- So i have notched it back down a little to be able to work with the problem in chunks. the goal for today is to implement the skeleton and make sure the structure around the main problem is working correctly. for 27 that means making sure the graph class is functional and without bugs and for p25 it means coming up with and writing shell code for a backtracking solution. 
#### 730pm updwork on p25ate:
- okkay so the methods and the stuff is filled in. ill work on making sure the input output and that stuff is working after dinner and then work on p25 instead of debugging the cyclic dependancy method (cuz it seems like its gonna need a coupel hours of work)
